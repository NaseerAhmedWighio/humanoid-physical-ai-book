# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Welcome to the Future of Human-Robot Interaction

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This 13-week course covers the fundamental concepts, practical implementations, and ethical considerations of creating intelligent humanoid robots that can interact with human environments.

### About This Course

This textbook takes a unique approach by integrating theoretical foundations with practical applications, ensuring you not only understand the concepts but can also implement them in real-world scenarios. We explore the intricate relationship between perception, cognition, and action in humanoid systems, examining how these robots can interact meaningfully with humans and their environment.

### Course Structure

The course is organized into 4 main modules over 13 weeks:

#### [Module 1: Introduction to ROS 2](./module-1-ros2/index.md) (Weeks 1-3)
- Understanding the Robot Operating System 2 framework
- Node-based architecture and communication patterns
- Message passing and service interactions
- Practical implementation of ROS 2 concepts

#### [Module 2: Simulation with Gazebo and Unity](./module-2-simulation/index.md) (Weeks 4-6)
- Advanced simulation environments for robotics
- Gazebo physics simulation and sensor modeling
- Unity integration for high-fidelity graphics
- Simulation-to-reality transfer techniques

#### [Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac for Humanoid Control](./module-3-nvidia-isaac/index.md) (Weeks 7-9)
- GPU-accelerated robotics with NVIDIA Isaac
- Perception systems and control algorithms
- Isaac Sim for AI training environments
- Integration with real hardware platforms

#### [Module 4: Vision Language Action (VLA) Models](./module-4-vla/index.md) (Weeks 10-13)
