## Prompt

Develop AI textbook spec for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics --stage spec --feature ai-textbook-humanoid

## Response snapshot

Successfully created comprehensive functional specification for AI-native textbook website on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics with user scenarios, functional requirements, success criteria, and validation checklist.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete functional specification for 13-week AI textbook course covering ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and VLA with 4 user stories, 14 functional requirements, and 6 success criteria
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs/001-ai-textbook-humanoid/spec.md, specs/001-ai-textbook-humanoid/checklists/requirements.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan to create implementation plan, /sp.tasks to break down implementation tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Structured specification with clear user journeys and measurable outcomes provides solid foundation for AI textbook development

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - full prompt preserved verbatim, stage and routing determined correctly, all metadata fields populated
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): none needed - specification complete and validated
